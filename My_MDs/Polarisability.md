# Polarisability
Tendency of an ion/atom to distort the electron cloud of neighbouring ion/atom by it's electric field is called **polarisability**.

### Factors affecting polarisability
- Large size & highly charged anions have greater **polarizing ability** 
- Cations not possessing noble gas e- configuration are easily polarized
- Small size & highly charged cations have greater **polarizing ability**

### Polarizability: A Case Study in Group 2 Fluorides

The negatively charged ligands polarize the electron cloud of the central atom and deforms its spherical symmetry. The repulsion between the ligand charges and the dipoles thus generated is minimized when the molecule has a bent structure (gaseous state).
