# Neighbourhood and Boundedness
<span class="yellow">Neighbourhood of a point</span>

<span class="blue">Def</span> : For a point $x \in \mathbb{R}$ and for $\epsilon>0$, the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $x$, denoted by $N(x ; \epsilon)$ or $N(x, \epsilon)$ or $N_{\epsilon}(x)$, is the following set:
$$
N(x, \epsilon)=(x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon)=\{y \in \mathbb{R}:|x-y|<\epsilon\} .
$$

<span class="yellow">Boundedness</span> 

<span class="blue">Def</span> : A real number l is said to be an upper bound of $S$ if $l \geq x$ $\forall x\in S$
<span class="blue">Def</span> : A real number l is said to be a lower bound of $S$ if $l ≤ x$ $\forall x\in S$

- A set S ⊆ R is said to be bounded above if it has an upper bound and bounded below if it has a lower bound. 
- Also, S is called bounded if it is both bounded above and bounded below
- The empty set ∅ is bounded above and below by any real number*

<span class="yellow">Supremum and Infimum</span> 

<span class="blue">Def</span> : Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be non-empty and bounded above. Then a real number $u$ is said to be the supremum or the least upper bound (lub) of $S$, if $u$ is an upper bound of $S$ and for any upper bound $v$ of $S, u \leq v$. We write $u=\sup S$.

<span class="blue">Def</span> : Let $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be nonempty and bounded below. Then a real number $/$ is said to be the infimum or the greatest lower bound (glb) of $S$, if $I$ is a lower bound of $S$ and for any lower bound $k$ of $S, k \leq I$. We write $I=\inf S$.
- If sup $S$ or inf $S$ belongs to the set $S$, we call them maximum or minimum of $S$ respectively.

Ex. 
1. Any finite subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is bounded.
2. The set $\mathbb{Q} \cap [\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}]$ is bounded.
3. For each of the sets $(a,b), [a,b], [a,b), (a,b]$, the supremum is b while the infremum is a.
