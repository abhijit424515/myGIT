# Octahedral complexes
### Symmetric vs Octahedral field
In a spherically symmetric ligand field, the d-orbitals of the metal centre are degenerate, since the electronic repulsion is symmetric.
However, when 6 ligands approach the metal centre along the (+x,-x,+y,-y,+z,-z) axes, they constitute an octahedral field. Since the 5 d-orbitals do not have the same shape, the octahedral field causes different extents of repulsions in them. Specifically, $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals face more repulsion than the $d_{xy}, d_{yz}, d_{xz}$ orbitals. 

This causes a splitting of the formerly-degenerate orbitals into 2 sets of orbitals : 
$$t_{2g}\space(d_{xy}, d_{yz}, d_{xz}) \space ,\space e_{g}\space(d_{x^2-y^2}, d_{z^2})$$

$$\text{CFSE} = -0.4\times n_{t_{2g}} + 0.6\times n_{e_g}$$

# Square planar complexes
Consider a $d^9$ system of octahedral complexes.

On analysing the absorptoin spectra, we find 3 peaks instead of 1.

To explain this, we consider [[Jahn-Teller distortion]] due to which the energy levels change, and thus we can explain the above diagram
