I have an issue with the way that most programming tutorials are written. There are far too many tutorials where you see *the “this is how you draw an owl” phenomenon*.

It’s almost as if the programmer had good intentions and started off by showing you how to do everything, step-by-step. But then, at some point, he realises that he has embarked on a Sisyphean task and gives up. I’ve seen tutorials where the author starts off with an excruciating level of detail then mid-way reverts to “now you simply set up a cloud database”. 

Bearing in mind that this is a tutorial aimed at *beginners*! This leads to a number of problems. 
The most common problem is a student who just copies the code in the tutorial and has no clue what any of it does. 
- Why did he add that extra line after parsing the JSON? 
- Why is he making this dictionary differently from the last one? 

It’s very easy to get knees deep in one of these types of tutorials because it promises to teach you how to build “Flappy Bird” or “Candy Crush”. 
But two-thirds of the way in, none of the things you’re typing makes sense and you start seeing red all over the screen. 

*Bugs. Loads of them. Why? No idea. Nothing runs*. 
The last 3 hours were spent copying code and you learnt nothing other than maybe that coding sucks. Don’t get into this trap. 
If you see a tutorial that has jumps from beginner to advanced after line 3 or uses the word “simply” too liberally or doesn’t explain any of their code, then stop. Leave that tutorial. There’s plenty of fish in the sea. 
Other times, the author does try to explain what they’re doing. But you still don’t understand a thing that they’re saying, then you’re in an advanced tutorial that won’t improve your programming. It can be tempting to build grand things, especially when the blog is promising that anyone can make it. But if you can’t work out what’s going on, you’re be better served by building a better foundation.

*The key to learning to code is all about ramping*. You want to be stretched over and over again and for knowledge to be built on previous knowledge. If that ramp is *too steep*, you’ll get lost. If that ramp is *too shallow*, you’ll get bored. The right gradient is different for everyone. 
That’s why we encourage students to use the speed change functionality liberally on our tutorials. This way, you can listen at double speed if you’re comfortable with the concepts and slow down to half speed if it’s something unfamiliar and you need time to understand and absorb.
