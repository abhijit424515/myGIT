# C++ OPERATORS
## 1. Arithmetic Operators =>
| Operator        | Name and Use                                                | 
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| +               | Addition                                                    |
| -               | Subtraction                                                 |
| *               | Multiplication                                              |
| /               | Division                                                    |
| %               | Modulus  (a%b outputs the remainder when a is divided by b) |
| a++ (with cout) | Print a, then increase it's value by 1                      |
| ++a (with cout) | Increase the value of a by 1, then print it's value         |
| a-- (with cout) | Print a, then decrease it's value by 1                      |
| --a (with cout) | Decrease the value of a by 1, then print it's value         |

## 2. Assignment Operators

## 3. Comparison Operators =>
| Operator     | Use                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| ```(a==b)``` | Check if a = b or not  |
| ```(a!=b)``` | Check if a != b or not |
| ```(a>b)```  | Check if a > b or not  |
| ```(a<b)```  | Check if a < b or not  |
| ```(a>=b)``` | Check if a >= b or not |
| ```(a<=b)``` | Check if a <= b or not |

## 4. Logical Operators =>
