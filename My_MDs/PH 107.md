### Lecture 04
Let **one** of the component waves of the **wave packet** representing a free particle be given by 
$$\Psi(x,t) = e^{i(kx-wt)}$$

Differentiating $\Psi(x,t)$ with respect to t gave, $\frac{\partial{\Psi}}{\partial{t}} = -iw\Psi$
Differentiating $\Psi(x,t)$ with respect to x **twice** gave, $\frac{\partial^2{\Psi}}{\partial{x}^2} = -k^2\Psi$

With manipulations, we can obtain $$i\hbar\frac{\partial{\Psi}}{\partial{t}} = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2{\Psi}}{\partial{x}^2}$$,which are equal to $E\Psi$

This equation is satisfied by the wave function of the form $\Psi(x,t) = e^{i(kx-wt)}$
However, this wave equation has infinite extent. 
For the equation to work for a wave-packet, we need to superimpose several such wave equations.

So, we consider $$\Psi(x,t) = \int{A(k).e^{i(kx-w(k)t)}dk}$$

Hence,
$$i\hbar\frac{\partial{\Psi}}{\partial{t}} = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}(\int{A(k).e^{i(kx-w(k)t)}dk})$$
