Software engineers are purportedly the profession that has the largest population of Imposter Syndrome sufferers. 
*Imposter Syndrome* is a psychological phenomenon where people feel like frauds and *massively underestimate* their own skills and abilities.

Programmers tend to be self-critical and constantly feel that everyone else is better at programming than they. If you’ve ever felt this way, you’re not alone, as studies show that a massive *70 percent of people have imposter syndrome*.

I recently saw a post on the Q&A site Quora where somebody asked: “Would I get fired at Google (or another big tech firm if I got caught using StackOverflow as a reference?” He got a bunch of really great answers from engineers working at Google, Amazon and other major tech companies. Anybody who has worked as a software engineer will tell you that not looking at references is far more frowned upon. In fact, I challenge you to find a single Google programmer who has not used Stack Overflow. (If you’re not familiar, StackOverflow is a collaborative Q&A site for programmers). 

A lot of new programmers are afraid that by checking references and asking people for help they will out themselves as a fraud who doesn’t know to programme. Nobody can hold all the relevant information in their head. For example, this is the name of an iOS method: 
```swift
- (id)initWithBitmapDataPlanes:(unsigned char **)planes pixelsWide:(NSInteger)width pixelsHigh:(NSInteger)height bitsPerSample:(NSInteger)bps samplesPerPixel:(NSInteger)spp hasAlpha:(BOOL)alpha isPlanar:(BOOL)isPlanar colorSpaceName:(NSString *)colorSpaceName bitmapFormat:(NSBitmapFormat)bitmapFormat bytesPerRow:(NSInteger)rowBytes bitsPerPixel:(NSInteger)pixelBits; 
```

It’s almost 400 characters! In iOS programming, there are over 800 classes, 9000 methods and growing. In web development, there’s a new framework every week.
No one will expect you to be able to remember the code. This is the precise reason why we are programmers, we can get the computer to do the boring stuff for us. 
For example, the code for recording sound is only a short search away, why would you need to memorise it? 

The skill that most employers look for when recruiting is the ability to think. Knowledge is valued in a world where information is hard to come by. In the 1800s, only the rich had access to good books and good teachers. Now, everyone has all the information they had and more at the tap of a mouse. 

*Information is losing value, the ability to think is the stock to buy*. So *don’t be afraid to search*, to ask on StackOverflow or to find resources to help you solve your issues. The best programmers do it. *The skill you need to hone is in asking good questions and understanding the answer*. There is no point copy-pasting code from a StackOverflow answer if you have no clue how it works. Because StackOverflow works on a reputation system, it’s in their interest to be as clear as possible in their answer in order to be marked as correct and collect upvotes. 

In most cases, it doesn’t make sense to start searching StackOverflow whenever you get stuck. The first option should always be trying to figure it out yourself. 
So your program doesn’t do what you expected it to, but before I typed the last 3 lines of code, it was working fine. So let’s figure out what in those last 3 lines broke my app? If you really can’t figure it out, start with Google. Search for your query or if you have a bug paste the error codes and the error message. 

Chances are that as a beginner, your programming woes will be very common and somebody might have even taken the time to write a clear and concise tutorial to help you understand your bug. As you grow more skilled in programming, the problems you’ll encounter get more and more obscure, but hopefully, if you followed the other 11 rules, you will also be a more capable programmer and figure it out yourself or know exactly where to get help. The other reason why you should start with Google is that StackOverflow’s search algorithm organises questions and answers by recency and not popularity. A lot of the problems you will encounter while starting out will have been asked and answered years ago but still massively popular. So ask wisely and you will reap the benefits from the community. 

One day when you yourself become a code master, you’ll be giving back to that same community and helping the next generation of programmers.
