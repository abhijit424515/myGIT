# Stationary states
A stationary state is a state with constant position, momentum (p=0), and other physical parameters, and definite energy.

- For any operator $\hat{O}$, constancy implies that $\hat{O}$ does not change with time.
- For any operator $\hat{O}$ and any state of a particle, definite value of a physical parameter means that the corresponding state 
is an eigenstate of the corresponding operator, with a fixed eigenvalue
