# Jahn-Teller distortion
It says that any non-linear molecular system in a degenerate electronic state will be unstable and will undergo distortion to form a system of lower symmetry and lower energy thereby removing the degeneracy.

For this distortion, there are 2 possibilities :
1. **Axial elongation**
    - The unpaired electron is in $d_{x^2-y^2}$
    - Due to more repulsion along z-axis, ligands can't approach well enough towards $d_{z^2}$. Also, it breaks the degeneracy of $t_{2g}$ orbitals, since ligands along z-axis are farther.
    - On the contrary, ligands are more approachable in the XY plane.

2. **Axial compression**
    - The unpaired electron is in $d_{z^2}$
    - Due to more repulsion along x-axis and y-axis, ligands can't approach well enough towards $d_{x^2-y^2}$. 
    - On the contrary, ligands are more approachable along the z-axis. Also, it breaks the degeneracy of $t_{2g}$ orbitals, since ligands along z-axis are closer.
