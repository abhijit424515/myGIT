# Volume of a solid
## M1 : Slice Method
Let $D$ be a bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. 
A cross-section of $D$ obtained by cutting $D$ by a plane in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is called a **slice** of $D$.

Let $a<b$, and suppose $D$ lies between the planes $x=a$ and $x=b$, which are perpendicular to the $x$-axis. For $s \in[a, b]$, consider the slice of $D$ by the plane $x=s$, namely $\{(x, y, z) \in D: x=s\}$, and suppose it has an 'area' $A(s)$.
To find the volume of $D$, we proceed as follows.
1. Partition $[a, b]$ into $a=x_{0}<x_{1}<\cdots<x_{n}=b$.
2. Pick sample points $s_{i} \in\left[x_{i-1}, x_{i}\right]$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$.
3. Volume between the planes $x=x_{i-1}$ and $x=x_{i}$ is approximated by the volume of a slab of width $(x_{i}-x_{i-1})$ and base area $A\left(s_{i}\right)$, that is, by $A\left(s_{i}\right)\left(x_{i}-x_{i-1}\right)$.
4. The sum of volumes of these slabs is $\sum_{i=1}^{n} A\left(s_{i}\right)\left(x_{i}-x_{i-1}\right)$.

Taking limit $n \rightarrow \infty$, we define the volume of $D$ by
$$
\operatorname{Vol}(D)=\int_{a}^{b} A(x) d x
$$
provided the 'area function' $A:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is integrable.

<span class="purple">Example</span> ->
1. Let $a>0$, and let $D$ denote the solid enclosed by the cylinders $x^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}$ and $x^{2}+z^{2}=a^{2}$. Then $D$ lies between the planes $x=-a$ and $x=a$. For $s \in[-a, a]$, the slice $\{(x, y, z) \in D: x=s\}$ is the square
    $$
    \left\{(s, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^{3}:|y| \leq \sqrt{a^{2}-s^{2}} \text { and }|z| \leq \sqrt{a^{2}-s^{2}}\right\},
    $$
    and so $A(s)=\left(2 \sqrt{a^{2}-s^{2}}\right)^{2}=4\left(a^{2}-s^{2}\right)$. Hence
    $\operatorname{Vol}(D)=\int_{-a}^{a} A(s) d s=4 \int_{-a}^{a}\left(a^{2}-s^{2}\right) d s=\frac{16 a^{3}}{3}$

### Solid of Revolution
If a subset $D$ of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is generated by revolving a planar region about an axis, then $D$ is known as a **solid of revolution**.

## M2 : Washer Method
Let $D$ be the solid obtained by revolving the region between the curves $y=f_{1}(x)$ and $y=f_{2}(x)$, and the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$, about the $x$-axis, where $0 \leq f_{1} \leq f_{2}$.
The slice of $D$ at $x \in[a, b]$ looks like a circular washer, that is, a disc of radius $f_{2}(x)$ from which a smaller disc of radius $f_{1}(x)$ has been removed, and so the area of the slice is $A(x):=\pi\left(f_{2}(x)^{2}-f_{1}(x)^{2}\right)$.
Suppose $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ are integrable on $[a, b]$. Then the area function $A$ is integrable on $[a, b]$, and by the slice method,
$$
\operatorname{Vol}(D)=\int_{a}^{b} A(x) d x=\pi \int_{a}^{b}\left(f_{2}(x)^{2}-f_{1}(x)^{2}\right) d x
$$
This special case of the slice method is called the **washer method**.

If the inner radius of a washer is equal to 0 , then the washer is in fact a disk. If this is the case for every $x \in[a, b]$, then the washer method is also known as the **disk method**.

## M3 : Shell Method
Let $D$ be a bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. A cross-section of $D$ obtained by piercing a cylinder through $D$ is called a **sliver** of $D$.

Let $f_{1}, f_{2}:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be such that $f_{1} \leq f_{2}$, and suppose $0 \leq a<b$. 
Let $D$ denote the solid generated by revolving the region between the curves $y=f_{1}(x)$ and $y=f_{2}(x)$, and the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ about the $y$-axis.

For $s \in[a, b]$, the sliver $\left\{(x, y, z) \in D: x^{2}+z^{2}=s^{2}\right\}$ of $D$ by the cylinder $x^{2}+z^{2}=s^{2}$ is a right circular cylinder having surface area $2 \pi s\left(f_{2}(s)-f_{1}(s)\right)$.

Suppose $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ are integrable on $[a, b]$. Since $D$ is 'made up' of these cylindrical slivers (or shells), we define
$$
\operatorname{Vol}(D):=2 \pi \int_{a}^{b} x\left(f_{2}(x)-f_{1}(x)\right) d x,
$$
given by the **shell method**.

### Parametrized Curve
A parametrized curve or a path $C$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is given by $(x(t), y(t))$, where $x, y:[\alpha, \beta] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are continuous functions. Here $[\alpha, \beta]$ is called the parameter interval.

### Arc Length of a Smooth Curve
We wish to define the 'length' of $C$. We shall assume that $C$ is smooth, that is, the functions $x, y$ are continuously differentiable on $[\alpha, \beta]$. This means that $x, y$ are differentiable on $[\alpha, \beta]$, and their derivatives $x^{\prime}, y^{\prime}$ are continuous on $[\alpha, \beta]$.

Partition $[\alpha, \beta]$ into $\alpha=t_{0}<t_{1}<\cdots<t_{n}=\beta .$ 
Let $P_{i}=\left(x\left(t_{i}\right), y\left(t_{i}\right)\right)$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$, and let us draw the line segments joining $P_{0}$ to $P_{1}, P_{1}$ to $P_{2}, \ldots, P_{n-1}$ to $P_{n}$.
The sum of the lengths of these line segments is
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{\left(x\left(t_{i}\right)-x\left(t_{i-1}\right)\right)^{2}+\left(y\left(t_{i}\right)-y\left(t_{i-1}\right)\right)^{2}} \\
=& \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{\left(x^{\prime}\left(s_{i}\right)\right)^{2}+\left(y^{\prime}\left(u_{i}\right)\right)^{2}}\left(t_{i}-t_{i-1}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
for some $s_{i}, u_{i} \in\left(t_{i-1}, t_{i}\right)$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$ by the MVT.

We define the arc length of $C$ by
$$
\ell(C):=\int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{x^{\prime}(t)^{2}+y^{\prime}(t)^{2}} d t
$$

---
### Arc Length in Polar coordinates
Let $C$ be given by a polar equation $r=p(\theta), \theta \in[\alpha, \beta]$. As a parametrized curve, $C$ is given by $(x(\theta), y(\theta))$, where
$$
x(\theta):=p(\theta) \cos \theta \quad \text { and } \quad y(\theta):=p(\theta) \sin \theta, \quad \theta \in[\alpha, \beta] .
$$
Suppose the function $p$ is continuously differentiable on $[\alpha, \beta]$.
For $\theta \in[\alpha, \beta]$, we note that $\sqrt{\alpha^{\prime}(\theta)^{2}+y^{\prime}(\theta)^{2}}$ is equal to
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \sqrt{\left(p^{\prime}(\theta) \cos \theta-p(\theta) \sin \theta\right)^{2}+\left(p^{\prime}(\theta) \sin \theta+p(\theta) \cos \theta\right)^{2}} \\
=& \sqrt{p(\theta)^{2}+p^{\prime}(\theta)^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$
Hence
$$
\ell(C):=\int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{p(\theta)^{2}+p^{\prime}(\theta)^{2}} d \theta
$$

### Curves in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
Suppose $C$ is a smooth parametrized curve in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ given by
$(x(t), y(t), z(t))$, where $x, y, z:[\alpha, \beta] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ are continuously differentiable functions on $[\alpha, \beta]$.
In analogy with the definition of the arc length of a curve in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, we define the arc length of $C$ by
$$
\ell(C):=\int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \sqrt{x^{\prime}(t)^{2}+y^{\prime}(t)^{2}+z^{\prime}(t)^{2}} d t
$$

### Surface of Revolution
A surface of revolution is generated when a curve $C$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is revolved about a line $L$ in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.

First suppose the curve $C$ is a slanted line segment $P_{1} P_{2}$ of length $\lambda_{2}$, and $C$ does not cross $L$. Let $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ denote the distances of $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ from $L$ with $d_{1} \leq d_{2}$. Then the surface of revolution is a frustum $F$ of a right circular cone with base radii $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$, and slant height $\lambda_{2}$. We find its surface area.

![](https://i.imgur.com/h5cpgsy.png)


The surface area of the frustrum $F$ of the cone is $\pi\left(d_{1}+d_{2}\right) \lambda_{2} .$

Now suppose $C$ is parametrized by $(x(t), y(t)), t \in[\alpha, \beta]$.

1. Partition $[\alpha, \beta]$ into $\alpha=t_{0}<t_{1}<\cdots<t_{n}=\beta .$
2. Let $P_{i}=\left(x\left(t_{i}\right), y\left(t_{i}\right)\right)$ for $i=0,1, \ldots, n$, and draw the line segments $P_{0} P_{1}, P_{1} P_{2}, \ldots, P_{n-1} P_{n} .$
3. Let $d_{0}, d_{1}, d_{2}, \ldots, d_{n}$ be the distances of $P_{0}, P_{1}, P_{2}, \ldots, P_{n}$ from the line L. Let $\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, \ldots, \lambda_{n}$ be the lengths of the line segments $P_{0} P_{1}, P_{1} P_{2}, \ldots, P_{n-1} P_{n}$. Suppose they don't cross $L$.

![](https://i.imgur.com/vutTbRy.png)


Fix $i \in\{1, \ldots, n\} .$ When the line segment $P_{i-1} P_{i}$ is revolved about the line $L$, it generates a frustum $F_{i}$ (of a right circular cone) whose surface area is $\pi\left(d_{i-1}+d_{i}\right) \lambda_{i}$.
Let $\rho(t)$ denote the distance of the point $(x(t), y(t))$ on the curve $C$ from the line $L$. Then $d_{i}=\rho\left(t_{i}\right)$ for $i=0,1, \ldots, n$.
Thus the sum of the surface areas of the frustrums $F_{1}, \ldots, F_{n}$ is
$$
\pi \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\rho\left(t_{i-1}\right)+\rho\left(t_{i}\right)\right) \lambda_{i}
$$
If the functions $x^{\prime}$ and $y^{\prime}$ are continuously differentiable on $[\alpha, \beta]$, then the length $\lambda_{i}$ of the line segment $P_{i-1} P_{i}$ is given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{i} &=\sqrt{\left(x\left(t_{i}\right)-x\left(t_{i-1}\right)\right)^{2}+\left(y\left(t_{i}\right)-y\left(t_{i-1}\right)\right)^{2}} \\
&=\sqrt{x^{\prime}\left(s_{i}\right)^{2}+y^{\prime}\left(u_{i}\right)^{2}}\left(t_{i}-t_{i-1}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
for some $s_{i}, u_{i} \in\left(t_{i-1}, t_{i}\right)$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$ (by the MVT).

If $C$ is a smooth curve, and does not cross the line $L$ given by $a x+b y+c=0$, then we define the area of the surface $S$ generated by revolving $C$ about the line $L$ by
$$
\text { Area }(S)=2 \pi \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} \rho(t) \sqrt{x^{\prime}(t)^{2}+y^{\prime}(t)^{2}} d t,
$$
where $\rho(t)$ is the distance of $(x(t), y(t))$ from the line $L$, given by
$$\rho(t)=\frac{|a x(t)+b y(t)+c|}{\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}}, \text{for}\space t \in[a, b]$$

**Special Case** : #question 
Let the line $L$ be given by $\theta=\gamma$, where $\gamma \in(-\pi, \pi]$, and let the curve $C$ be given by $r=p(\theta)$ for $\theta \in[\alpha, \beta]$, where $p$ is continuously differentiable on $[\alpha, \beta]$. Suppose $C$ does not cross $L$. Now the curve $C$ is also given by $(p(\theta) \cos \theta, p(\theta) \sin \theta)$ for $\theta \in[\alpha, \beta]$.
Also, $\rho(\theta)=p(\theta)|\sin (\theta-\gamma)|$ for $\theta \in[\alpha, \beta]$.
$$
\text { Thus Area }(S)=2 \pi \int_{\alpha}^{\beta} p(\theta)|\sin (\theta-\gamma)| \sqrt{p(\theta)^{2}+p^{\prime}(\theta)^{2}} d \theta \text {. }
$$
