[[C++ INDEX]]

# C++ ORDER OF COMPILATION
The compiler, in-general, goes top to bottom, and compiles commands given outside and before the main() function.
After reaching main(), it executes it, and the subsequent sub-functions, in the order defined in main().

**After compiling main(), it moves forward to other commands written after main().**
