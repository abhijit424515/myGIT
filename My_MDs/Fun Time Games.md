## Straight Face

All players write sentences on small pieces of paper. 
What kind of sentences? 
Ones that are ridiculous or inappropriate; sentences that anyone would struggle to read (or hear) while keeping a straight face.
One at a time, each player will choose a slip of paper and attempt to read whatever is written on it without giggling or cracking a smile.
All of you can collectively decide the punishment for failure.

##  The Name Game

One person starts by naming a celebrity, fictional character, sports icon etc. No personal or friend's names.
So if itâ€™s Julia Roberts, for example, the next person has to think of another celebrity, whose name starts with the first letter of the last name. 
The next person could say Rahul Dravid, and then the person after has to come up with someone whose name begins with D, 
and so on and so forth.
If someone drops a name with the same letter for the first and last name, like Kim Kardashian, the player rotation reverses.
