# Sequences and Series
<span class="yellow">Sequences</span> 

<span class="blue">Def</span> : A sequence in a set X is a function $f : N→X$
- Denoted by ${\{a_n\}}_{n=1}^{\infty}$, or ${\{a_n\}}$, or $(a_n)$

<span class="blue">Def</span> : A sequence $\left\{a_{n}\right\}$ is said to be $\rightarrow$
- monotonically increasing or just increasing if $a_{n} \leq a_{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$
- strictly increasing if $a_{n}<a_{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$;
- monotonically decreasing or just decreasing if $a_{n} \geq a_{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$
- strictly decreasing if $a_{n}>a_{n+1}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

<span class="yellow">Bounded sequences</span> 

<span class="blue">Def</span> : A sequence $\{a_n\}$ is said to be bounded if  $\exists\space M > 0$ such that $|a_n| ≤ M, \forall n ∈ \mathbb N$.

<span class="red">[[Lem001]]</span> : Every convergent sequence is bounded

<span class="orange">[[The001]]</span> : A montonically increasing (resp. decreasing) sequence which is bounded above (resp. below) converges.

<span class="yellow">Infinite series of real numbers</span>

Suppose $\left\{x_{n}\right\}$ is a sequence of real numbers. Then $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_{n}$ or simply $\Sigma x_{n}$ denotes an infinite series of real numbers. 
Let $\{S_n\}$ be defined as $\rightarrow$
$$
S_{n}=x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}, \quad n \in \mathbb{N} .
$$
Then $\left\{S_{n}\right\}$ is called the sequence of partial sums of the series $\Sigma x_{n}$. 
- We say that the series $\sum x_{n}$ converges to a real number $x$ if the sequence of partial sums $\left\{S_{n}\right\}$ converges to $x$. 
- The real number $x$ is called the sum of the series $\Sigma x_{n}$. 
- If $\left\{S_{n}\right\}$ diverges, then we say that the series $\sum x_{n}$ diverges.
