Whenever I do large talks, there will always be one person who asks me “*which programming language should I start learning first*”? There is this common perception that somewhere out there lies a perfect language for beginner programmers. Some argue it’s Python, some say it’s Swift. 

But I say they’re all wrong. A programming language is *simply a tool*. It is no different from any other tool in your hardware box. 
If you want to hammer a nail, you should be using a hammer. If you want to fix your water pipes, you’ll probably need a spanner. Yes, it’s possible to hammer in a nail using the side of the spanner and the same programming language can be used to solve different types of problems. The carpenter will tell you that his favourite tool is a hammer and the plumber will say it’s the spanner, but it still doesn’t make it the “best tool to fix things”. A web developer will tell you that JavaScript is the best language to learn for a beginner. A statistician will advise you that you’ll be best served with the R programming language. 

But at the end of the day, all that matters is what you are trying to do with your tool. If you want to make iOS apps, then learn Swift. If you want to make websites, you’ll need JavaScript. 

But the good news is the core programming concepts: loops, conditionals, functions, etc. they’re all the same. *The difference is mostly syntactical*. 
In English, we have werewolves, in German they have Werwölfe. It’s still the same shirt-ripping mammal that comes out during a full moon, it’s just spelt differently. 

Printing to the console in Swift: 
```swift
print(“Hello Werewolves”)
``` 
Printing to the console in Java: 
```java
println(“Hello Werewolves”)
``` 
So, decide on the task that you are trying to accomplish, then pick the best tool for that task.
