### Chiral Molecules with no chiral centers

These molecules are axially chiral (axial asymmetry) arises due to restricted rotation around the C-C bond, even though they don't have chiral centres

### MESO
Though the following stereoisomer of tartaric acid possesses two chiral centers, a pure sample of this compound is optically inactive.**Internal Compensation OR presence of plane of symmetry!**

### RACEMIC MIXTURE
When there is equal composition (1:1) of enantiomers in the mixture, the resulting solution is optically inactive.
**External compensation OR cancellation due to opposite optical rotations**

**Note** : Nature always forms L-type of amino acids, and D-type of carbohydrates

### Properties of Enantiomers differ in Chiral medium

## Stereoisomers
![[Pasted image 20220107091032.png]]

**Note** : If the energy barrier is high enough then there is restricted rotation about $\sigma$-bond, and so a molecule may exist for a relatively long time period as a stable **rotational isomer** or **rotamer** (an isomer arising from hindered single-bond rotation). 
When the time scale for interconversion is long enough for isolation of individual rotamers (usually arbitrarily defined as a half-life of interconversion of 1000 seconds or longer), the isomers are termed **atropisomers**
