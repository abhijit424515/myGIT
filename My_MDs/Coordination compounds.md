### Stabilizing complexes with low/high OS metal centres 
- $\pi$ acceptor ligands for low OS (like [Cr(CO)6]) 
- moderate ligands like NH3 and H2O for intermediate OS (like [Cr(Cl)3(H2O)3])
- oxide / fluoride ligands for high OS

### Factors affecting CN/geometry of complexes
1. Size :
    - Larger size of metal centre implies more ligands can donate, thus CN $\uparrow$
    - Larger size of ligands causes steric hindrance,  thus CN $\downarrow$ 
2. Electronic factors :
    - Hard ligands bind with hard metal centres, and since they are small in size, so CN $\uparrow$, while reverse is true for Sf-Sf interactions.
    - Counter ions having low basicity aid towards low CN in complexes, and converse is true.
