# Beyond simplecpp
```
#include<simplecpp> 
``````
The above header file includes the following commands :
```
#include<iostream>
#include<cmath>
using namespace std;
// and others, but these are the standard ones
```

The other header files include those for graphics, so without simplecpp, we cannot use MSLOGO graphics.

So, finally a very simplecpp program may look like
```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	//code
}
```
