[[A Step towards Sustainability]]

# Electric scooters and cars

### Steps :
- ~~Collaboration with MNCs to help them understand the Indian market better~~  
- Stressing the need to procure parts from Indian manufacturers, causing the tax/duties to be relaxes
    (if the MNC really wants a significant piece of the Indian market)
- Reaching out to and collaborating with local repair shops for training
- Government incentivisation to create more charging stations in the urban areas

Awareness campaigns + gov. incentivisation
