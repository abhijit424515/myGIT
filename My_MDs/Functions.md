<span class="blue">Def</span> : Let $X, Y\neq\emptyset$ . A function/map/mapping $f$ from $X$ to $Y$, denoted by $f: X \rightarrow Y$, is a rule of correspondence that assigns to each element $x \in X$, a unique point $y \in Y$. 

- Here $X$ and $Y$ are called the domain and the co-domain of $f$ respectively. 
- The point $y$ is said to be the image of $x$ under $f$ and we write $f(x)=y$. 
- Also, the point $x$ is called a pre-image of $y$ under $f$ and we write $x \in f^{-1}(y)$.
- The set $\{f(x): x \in X\}$ is called the range of $f$ and is denoted by $f(X)$

<span class="blue">Def</span> : A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is said to be one-one or injective if for $x_1,x_2\in X, x_{1} \neq x_{2}$$\implies f\left(x_{1}\right) \neq f\left(x_{2}\right)$.

<span class="blue">Def</span> : A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is said to be onto or surjective if $f(X)=Y$.

<span class="blue">Def</span> : A function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is said to be bijective if it is both injective and surjective.
