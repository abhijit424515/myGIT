# Example-6 -> Cyclohexane

If the ring is planar ==> Angle strain and Torsional strain
Compromise => Ring puckering (relieves both Angle strain and Torsional strain)

Ring puckering leads to “CHAIR” and “BOAT” conformers

### AXIAL AND EQUATORIAL BONDS ->

### RING INVERSION / FLIPPING ->

Note : In monosubstituted (small groups) cyclohexanes the ring flipping is of the order of 104 to 105 inversions/second

<span class="orange">POINTS to remember while ring-inversion is done ==></span> 
- Groups which are above the average plane would continue to remain above the avg. plane even after ring flipping.

- A cis-isomer would remain as cis-isomer, so is trans

### Why Axial–R group is disfavored?
1. Van der Waals repulsion between the axial methyl group and the axial hydrogens at C3 and C5 is known as 1,3-diaxial interactions

2. ‘gauche-butane’ type interaction in axial position
