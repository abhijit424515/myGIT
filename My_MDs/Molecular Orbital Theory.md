# Molecular Orbital Theory
[Molecular Orbitals of The Allyl Cation, Allyl Radical, and Allyl Anion (masterorganicchemistry.com)](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2017/02/16/molecular-orbitals-of-the-allyl-cation-allyl-radical-and-allyl-anion/)

## The Molecular Orbitals For The Allyl System (N=3)
What about the middle orbital, π2 ? It should have **one** node, and be intermediate in energy between π1 and π3

It’s actually incorrect!
Why? That’s a good question, and the answer isn’t obvious. It turns out that because of the way the math works in the Schrodinger equation, the nodes are always “balanced” with respect to the centre of the orbital. The node can’t just be placed anywhere; when there is one node, it **must** be in the centre. (By the way, this is a general feature of MO’s where the number of contributing orbitals is odd, e.g. N=3, N=5, N=7… the first node will be on the central carbon.)

**The Node Goes In The Middle!**
That means that the node is _directly_ on that middle carbon.

Now, if we arrange these orbitals together by energy (most stable at bottom) we get the following orbital diagram for the allyl system.

## Extended Conjugation and Colour
If the conjugation is extended further, the gap between HOMO and LUMO will decrease to allow the compound to absorb visible light and hence would become COLOURED.
- Lycopene, the red pigment present in tomatoes and other berries
- beta-carotene, the red pigment present in carrots and other vegetables

The colour of the blue jeans come from the pigment indigo
    Jeans are generally dyed by immersion in a vat of reduced indigo, which is colourless since there is no conjugation. When the cloth is hung up to dry, the oxygen in the air oxidizes the pigment to indigo and the jeans turn blue.
    
## Generalizations for acylic polyenes
- The lowest energy orbital is always symmetric with respect to the principal mirror plane
- The number of nodes increases by ONE upon going from a lower energy orbital to the next higher energy orbital
- Nodes must be symmetrically located with respect to the central mirror plane
- In molecules with an odd number of atoms in the conjugated chain, the nodes can go through an atom

Q. Is it possible to calculate the ‘width’ of the band, in an approximate fashion? #question
Q. Is it possible to estimate the energies of the p-molecular orbitals? #question 

## Huckel MO Theory
Basic Approximations :
- Used for the treatment of conjugated systems
• The $\pi$-system is treated independently of the $\sigma$-framework in planar conjugated molecules
• Or $\pi$-system do not interact with the $\sigma$-skeleton
• Interactions between p-$\pi$ orbitals located on atoms which are not directly linked is zero.

**pi-electron approximation**: $\pi$-electrons move in some fixed effective potential of $\sigma$ framework

## Energies of MOs in terms of Integrals
The energy of each p-orbital before interaction is set equal to $\alpha$ (**Coulomb integral**)
- refers to energy of an electron in the field of its own nucleus
- can be taken as valence state ionization potential

The interaction energy between two adjacent p-$\pi$ orbitals equals to $\beta$ (**Resonance integral**)
- refers to energy of i th electron in the field of j th nucleus
- can be taken as the interaction between atomic orbitals i and j
- energy of an electron in the field of two or more nuclei

**Note** : 
1. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are negative, representing attractive forces
2. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are not calculated as numerical values, but the energies are expressed in these terms

## Energies of MOs (Frost Circle)
The energy of an MO for a <span class="yellow">cyclic polyene</span> with N p-$\pi$ orbitals is given by,
$$
e_j = \alpha + 2\beta.cos(\frac{2\pi}{N})k
$$
, where |k| = 0,1,2...,floor(N/2)

The energy of an MO for a <span class="yellow">linear unbranched conjugated polyene</span> with N p-$\pi$ orbitals is given by,
$$
e_j = \alpha + 2\beta.cos(\frac{\pi}{N+1})k
$$
, where k = 1,2...,N

## Huckel’s Rule of Aromaticity
- Planar, fully conjugated, monocyclic systems with (4n+2)p electrons having a closed shell of electrons all in bonding orbitals are exceptionally stable. Such compounds are said to be aromatic
- Analogous systems with 4n p electrons are described as anti-aromatic

The compound must have an uninterrupted cyclic p-cloud of electrons
- For the p-cloud to be cyclic, the molecule must be cyclic.
- For the p-cloud to be uninterrupted, every atom in the ring must have a p-orbital
- For the p-cloud to form, each p-orbital must be able to overlap with the p-orbitals on either side of it. This means that the molecule must be planar.

## Modern definition of aromaticity
Compounds that possesses the ability to sustain induced ring current when subjected to magnetic field
