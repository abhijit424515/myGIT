# Chemistry of Transition Metals
- In complex formation, metal ion is a Lewis acid, while ligands are Lewis bases.
- Transition metal ions generally form complexes with well-defined number of ligands
### Trend of oxidation states among transition metals
- increase from Sc to Mn
- decrease from Mn to Zn
- stability of higher OS decreases from Sc to Zn
- stability of higher OS increases down the group
