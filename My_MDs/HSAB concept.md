| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| large + charge                                       | small + charge                                   |
| small size                                           | large size                                       |
| difficult to polarise                                | easy to polarise                                 |
| d-electrons/orbitals NOT available for $\pi$ bonding | d-electrons/orbitals available for $\pi$ bonding |

| Hard base             | Soft base                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| EN high               | EN low                    |
| small size            | large size                |
| difficult to polarise | easy to polarise          |
| $\pi$ bonding is weak | $\pi$ bonding is stronger | 

To form a stable complex, we can use : 
1. Hd-Hd interactions (predominantly ionic) (stronger)
2. Sf-Sf interactions (predominantly covalent) (weaker)

| **Bases** | NH3 to F-, $\text{O}^{2-}$, 1st & 2nd period -ate ions | Br-, NO2-, SO32-, N2, $\text{N}_3^-$, C6H5N, SCN- | H-, R-, I-, CO, CN-, NCS-, PR3, C6H5, R2S                                       |

### MOT in HSAB
In hard acids/bases, HOMO-LUMO gap is large, while in soft acids/bases, HOMO-LUMO gap is small.
- Hence, we can also reason out why Hd-Hd interactions are stronger than Sf-Sf interactions.

---
### Quantitative HSAB
We define **absolute hardness** $\eta$ as 
$$\eta = \frac{IE_{base}-EA_{acid}}{2}$$
, where both IE and EA are in eV.

- Softness $\sigma = 1/\eta$.

### Applications of HSAB
1. For the ambidental ligand SCN-, if the metal centre is Si+4 (hard acid), then N-atom (hard base) attacks the metal centre, while if the metal centre is Pt+2 (soft acid), then S-atom (soft base) attacks the metal centre.
2. Targeted synthetic approach : $BeI_2 + HgF_2 \rightarrow BeF_2 + HgI_2$ #question 
3. In the van Arkel method, Ti reacts with I2 to form TiI4
    $$Ti + 2I_2 \rightarrow TiI_4$$
    Since Ti+4 is hard acid, while I- is soft base, TiI4 easily decomposes upon heating to give pure Ti.  
4. In haemoglobin, binding of O2 to Fe+2 metal centre is reversible, since O2 is hard base but Fe+2 is borderline acid.
