# General Terms
### Mathematical object
A mathematical object is anything that has been formally defined, and using which we can do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs.

### Set
A set is a collection of mathematical objects.

### Metric
A metric is a function that gives the distance between each pair of points in a set.

### Structure
A structure is a set of mathematical objects having some additional features on the set, like operations,relations,metric or topology.

### Mathematical space
A mathematical space is a set with some added structure.

#### Metric space
A metric space is a non-empty set of points, together with a matric on the set.

#### Topological space
A topological space is a non-empty set of points, along with a set of neighbourhoods for each point, satisfying a set of axioms. It is the most general type of a mathematical space that allows for the definition of limits, continuity and connectedness.


## Homeomorphism 
A homeomorphism is a mapping $f:A\rightarrow B$, where $A,B\subset\mathbb{R^n}$, such that
1. it is bijective
2. it is continuous
3. it has a continuous inverse

## Isomorphism
An isomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping between 2 structures of the same type, that can be reversed by an inverse mapping.

# Manifolds
An *n-dimensional manifold* is a topological space that has the property that each point has a neighbourhood which is *homeomorphic* to an open set of n-dimensional Euclidean space.

# Diffeomorphism
Generally, a *diffeomorphism* is an *isomorphism* of *smooth manifolds*. 
It is an invertible function that maps one differentiable manifold to another, such that both the function and its inverse are differentiable.

Practically, a diffeomorphism is a mapping $f:A\rightarrow B$, where $A,B\subset\mathbb{R^n}$, such that
1. $A,B$ are open sets
2. it is bijective
3. it is differentiable
4. it has a differentiable inverse
