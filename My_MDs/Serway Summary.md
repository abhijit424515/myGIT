#### The basic assumptions for the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for a system of particles :
• The particles are identical in terms of physical properties but distinguishable in terms of position, path, or trajectory. This assumption is equivalent to the statement that the particle size is small compared with the average distance between particles.
• The equilibrium distribution is the most probable way of distributing the particles among various allowed energy states subject to the constraints of a fixed number of particles and fixed total energy.
• <span class=red>There is no theoretical limit on the number of particles in a given energy state, but the density of particles is sufficiently low and the temperature sufficiently high that no more than one particle is likely to be in a given state at the same time.</span>
