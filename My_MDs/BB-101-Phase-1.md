#### Why are cells so small ?
For any cell, maximizing surface area to volume ratio helps in efficient exchange of heat and matter(ex. intake of nutrients and removing wastes).
Thus, they usually have a small size.
However, dependence of free energy change associated with a reaction on the local concentrations of the reactants and products is another reason.
