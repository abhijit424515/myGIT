# Ligand Field Theory
## LCAO in MOT
This modelling of a molecular orbital in terms of contributing atomic orbitals is called the **linear combination of atomic orbitals** (LCAO) approximation, i.e. only the **valence shell atomic orbitals** are used to form molecular orbitals.

For two atomic orbitals $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, 
1. $\Psi_+ = \chi_1 + \chi_2$ denotes constructive overlap (**bonding molecular orbital**)
2. $\Psi_- = \chi_1 - \chi_2$ denotes destructive overlap (**anti-bonding molecular orbital**)

In general, the wavefunction $\Psi$ is
$$
\Psi = c_1 \chi_1 + c_2 \chi_2
$$

**$\eta$ - Nonbonding molecular orbital **
It is a molecular orbital that has the same energy as the initial atomic orbitals. In this case, occupation of this orbital neither stabilizes nor destabilizes the molecule and so it is described as a nonbonding orbital.

**$\sigma$ - orbital**
They are formed by allowing overlap between atomic orbitals that have cylindrical symmetry around the internuclear axis, which is conventionally labelled z.

**g and u formalism (with respect to inversion symmetry)**
The operation of inversion consists of starting at an arbitrary point in the molecule, travelling in a straight line to the centre of the molecule, and then continuing an equal distance out on the other side of the centre. 
The orbital is designated **g** (for gerade, even) if it is identical under inversion, and **u** (for ungerade, odd) if it changes sign.

### Molecular Orbital of heterodiatomic molecule
The molecular orbitals of heteronuclear diatomic molecules differ from those of homonuclear diatomic molecules in having unequal contributions from each atomic orbital.
- For $\Psi = c_1 \chi_1 + c_2 \chi_2$, $c_1^2$ > $c_2^2$ OR $c_1^2$ < $c_2^2$

**Example** =>
Consider HF molecule

- The 1$\sigma$ bonding orbital is predominantly F-2s in character as the energy difference between it and the H-1s orbital is large. It is,
therefore, confined mainly to the F atom and essentially non-bonding $\eta$.
- The 2$\sigma$ orbital is more bonding than the 1$\sigma$ orbital and has both H-1s and F-2p character. 
- The 3$\sigma$ orbital is antibonding, and principally H-1s in character. The 1s orbital has a relatively high energy (compared with the fluorine orbitals) and hence contributes predominantly to the high energy anti-bonding molecular orbital $\sigma^*$.

### LFT for $ML_6$ complexes
- Valence AOs of 3d metal ions (3d,4s,4p) are considered.
- Only a specific combination of the AOs (Symmetry Adopted Linear Combination (SALC)). In simpler terms, ligand orbitals are placed in certain symmetry so as to have maximum overlap with metal atomic orbitals.
- Energies of MOs are based on the overlap of metal and ligand AOs.
