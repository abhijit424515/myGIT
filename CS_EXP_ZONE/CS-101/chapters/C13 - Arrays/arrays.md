### differences between arrays and vectors
- vectors is a new mechanism, available only in C++
- arrays have fixed size, while vectors have variable sizes

---
## important points
- When initializaing arrays, we need to specify it's size one-way or another. So, we either write the ordered set of elements in the array, or specify the size
```
int a[]={5,4,1,2,3};
int a[5];

int a[7]={1,2,5}; // we can also do this, where the other indices have null value
```
