In C++, we are breaking down the different processes used in making the program into member functions.
This way, for large programs, we don't need to worry about the whole code, and only focus on specific units.

In contrast, since in C language we can't use classes, we have to keep many variables and objects in our mind during coding, which is a problem for large code files.
