The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it! 
Connect to the program with netcat: 
```$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 49698```

The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/541/program-redacted.c).

On examining the source code, flag gets printed when strtol returns 0 in data_read().
Checking the man page for strtol [here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strtol.3.html),  
- it converts string to long integer
- 1st arg is string, 2nd arg is pointer to the position of string from where non-decimal characters start, while 3rd arg is the base of number
- checking the errors section, if an invalid number (say some text) was passed, then also strtol returns 0.

Thus, we will first write some data, then when we read it, in the entry number we can either put 0 or some non-integer string, and thus the flag will be printed
