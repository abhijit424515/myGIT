Using a computer or smart device happens in 1 of 2 ways:
1.  Using a pointer such as a mouse, touchpad or finger to select apps, files, or buttons
2.  Using keys on a keyboard to enter simple or complex commands (the Shell)

Thankfully, there are TLAâ€™s (Three Letter Acronyms) for both methods described above:
1.  GUI. Pronounced "gooey," stands for Graphical User Interface
2.  CLI. Sounded out: "See-El-Eye," stands for Command Line Interface

Here is a screenshot of an empty shell

- Q0h313th is the username
